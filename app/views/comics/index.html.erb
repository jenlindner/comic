<!--p>What makes street art so irrestible? The audacity? The razor-sharp social commentary? Maybe it's the pretty pictures themselves.</p>

<p>Or is it that in public, some things can only be said with pictures?</p>

<p>Yes. Of course.</p>

<p>Graffiti goes back to the very beginning of writing, in ancient Sumeria. Writing was invented for kings, to keep track of their financial transactions. By a special class of workers who were the only ones to ever learn the bizarre practice... who clearly also invented graffiti. To complain about taxes.</p>
<p> That's where we get "the writing is on the wall." Because after all, it always is.</p-->
